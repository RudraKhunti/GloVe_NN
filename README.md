## Introduction

GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. This project integrates GloVe with a GRU model to process and understand text data, which is useful in various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and language modeling.

## Setup

To run this project, you need to have the following:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.15.0
- Gensim for handling word embeddings
- wget for downloading GloVe vectors

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gru-glove-nlp.git
   cd gru-glove-nlp
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow gensim
   ```

3. Download the GloVe embeddings:
   ```bash
   wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip
   unzip glove.6B.zip
   ```

## Usage

1. **Load GloVe Embeddings**: Load and prepare the GloVe embeddings to be used in your model.
2. **Define the GRU Model**: Create a GRU-based architecture suitable for your NLP task.
3. **Train the Model**: Train the model using your text dataset.
4. **Evaluate the Model**: Assess the performance on the validation or test set.

## Results

After training, the notebook provides insights into the model's performance through evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, along with visualizations like loss and accuracy plots over epochs.
